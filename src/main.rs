//! **Export CodeTour file to md**
//!
//!
//! CodeTour is a fantastic extension for VSCode. Kudos to the authors.  
//! <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour>  
//! Every CodeTour contains steps.  
//! Each step has a description and a link to the file and line number in the source code.  
//! No more out of sync examples in the documentation.  
//! This type of documentation is meant to be used for code flow explanation.  
//! To show other programmers the important information step by step in a logical order for humans.  
//! This extension for now works only inside VSCode. That is a problem for coders with other editors.  
//!
//! ## markdown
//!
//! In the present version (2020-04-27) the extension has no functionality to export to a markdown file.  
//! I don't have enough knowledge in vs code extensions and Typescript to make a PR contribution.  
//! So I make a rust tiny small CLI program.  
//! I prepared this project as a proof of concept how the "export to md" could look like.  
//! The resulting md is very nice. It is a file and therefore it can be committed to Github.  
//! In the md there are links to the source code on Github.  
//! This way all coders can follow the code flow on the actual code.  
//!
//! ## example
//!
//! I copied to the folder example/ a few files from my other project where I use CodeTour.  
//! There are 2 similar *.tour files. The CLI will export all tours files in that folder.  
//! Without any arguments the CLI will look at the standard `.tour/` folder.  
//! If the files are in another folder, like for my example, the argument is like this:  
//! `codetour_export_to_md folder=example/.tours`  
//!
//! ## GitHub and working example
//!
//! In my other project I tried to write some documentation about the code flow.  
//! It was horrific.  
//! I avoided copy/paste the source code because in no time it is obsolete and misleading.  
//! <https://github.com/LucianoBestia/mem6_game/blob/master/CodeFlow.md>  
//! Now I exported the md from CodeTour and it is amazing:  
//! <https://github.com/LucianoBestia/mem6_game/blob/master/codetour_start_route_template_render.md>  
//! The step by step approach jumping from module to module is great.  
//! It just hides all the other non-important code for basic human understanding of the code flow.  
//! And the links are "alive", they go to the actual code in Github.  
//!
